      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting a small blog to help me keep track of my work and explain some of the concepts or projects that I am currently learning and working on. Ideally as I start to work on more projects, this will become a great source of information for anyone that is wanting to start a career in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-goals&#34;&gt;Future Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement fun and impactful AI solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build cool things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My list of goals for the future may seem simple to most people but right now this is what I want to do. My favorite part about coding is that I can build something that does something for myself or for other people. I would consider myself to be a creative builder more than anything else. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if it is AI or robotics or even wood working. I just love to create things for myself and the people in my life to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
