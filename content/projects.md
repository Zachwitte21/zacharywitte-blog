## MCP Servers

I've built several Model Context Protocol servers:

- **International Weather** - This is a local MCP server that you can download from my github and use with application like claude desktop to give models access to international weather data. This was the second MCP server that I made and it was programmed in typescript. https://github.com/Zachwitte21/Open-Meteo-MCP-Server
- **National Weather Service** - This is a local MCP server that I built using python to give AI models access to the National Weather Service Forcasts and Alerts. https://github.com/Zachwitte21/weather-mcp

## University of Delaware Virtual Campus

During college at the University of Delaware I conducted drone research on a small team of 6 students where we used drones to take scans of buildings and then recreate them as 3d models using photogrammetry and machine learning. At the end of the year I took those scans and create a virtual tour website that anyone can use to fly around the UDel campus and see what it looks like.

## Python Compiler

This is a project that I build during college at the University of Delaware. It is a basic compiler that I built in python! Through this project I learned a lot about how compilers work, code coverage, and unit testing.
