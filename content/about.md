Hi, I'm Zachary Witte. I'm a software developer focused on building tools and exploring AI integrations.

I work with modern web technologies and enjoy creating practical solutions to real problems. Currently, I'm building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and experimenting with AI-powered applications.

This blog is where I share what I'm learning, document my projects, and write about software development.
